# Bitwise React Couse - Movie App

This project is for my Bitwise React course. I am learning to make React components and hook up to the [OMDB api.](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
